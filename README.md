# Password-Generator-code

## Description

The Password-Generator is for the user to generate a random and secure password that meets the user's criteria.

The purpose of the Password-Generator is to apply what I have learned in Javascript. It was definitely a challenging project. There were different ways of writing it and execute it. Had to do research the different arrays that best suit the code. Defining the variables and writing the While and If statements. 

## Features 
* Defining Variable
* Array.concat()
* While Stament
* If Statement
* Styling Attribute
